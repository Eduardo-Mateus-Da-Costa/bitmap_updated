# Flutter Bitmap

A minimalist flutter package to help you manipulate bitmaps.
The focus here is to prove bitmap manipulations.

The package standard format is RGBA32.

For now, things like format encoding, exif and multi-frame images are not the concern of this package. If that is your need, check [`image`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image). Some of the algorithms are heavily inpired by this awesome lib.
